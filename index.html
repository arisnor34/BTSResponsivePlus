          <h2>Why BTS?</h2>
          <h3>The World Phenomenon</h3>
          <p>
            BTS (Korean: ë°©íƒ„ì†Œë…„ë‹¨) is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010. The group includes seven members: Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. Originally a hip hop group, BTS has evolved its musical style to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics address various subjects, such as mental health, school-age troubles, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. 
            </p>
            <p>BTS has gained global recognition for their cultural influence and popularity, being named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of the year in 2019 and the first non-western and non-English speaking artist to be named IFPI's Global Recording Artist of the Year in 2020. Their impact on the global expansion of Korean culture and the South Korean economy is substantial, with approximately $5 billion USD added each year.
          </p>
          <p>BTS has also been recognized for their contributions to promoting friendly relations between South Korea and other countries, such as France and the United States. The group addressed the United Nations General Assembly in 2018, performed before President Moon Jae-in at the 2018 Korea-France Friendship Concert, and received the James A. Van Fleet Award for their outstanding contributions to the promotion of US-Korea relations in 2020. BTS even visited the White House in 2022 to discuss the recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination with US President Joe Biden. Their influence and impact extend beyond their music and have earned them a prominent place in global culture.</p>

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Skye and I'm a frontend developer living in Oklahoma, USA. 
              While my sister considers herself to be an Army, I am more of a casual fan 
              of the music of BTS and their members. I created this page as part of a 
              project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills.
